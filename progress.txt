[2026-01-10] #4 feat: add progress indicator and approval flow to create command
- Files: src/commands/create.ts, src/lib/claude.ts, src/index.ts, src/lib/claude.test.ts
- Changes: Added visual framing around Claude streaming output, ticket preview before creation, inquirer confirmation with create/edit/cancel options, and --yes flag for CI automation.
- Decisions: Used chalk for visual frame borders, accumulated hints across regeneration cycles, truncated body preview at 500 chars.

[2026-01-10] #11 fix: replace bordered table with section-based ticket preview
- Files: src/commands/create.ts
- Changes: Replaced logger.box() bordered table with clean section-based format using chalk styling. Labels displayed inline, body content shown with indentation for readability.
- Decisions: Used bold cyan headers for sections, removed 500-char truncation to show full body content for better review.

[2026-01-10] #10 fix: strip AI preamble from generated ticket bodies
- Files: src/lib/claude.ts, src/lib/claude.test.ts
- Changes: Added explicit instruction in prompt to start with "## Description" without preamble. Updated extractIssueBody to strip any text before "## Description" as safety measure.
- Decisions: Two-layer defense: prompt instruction + extraction cleanup.

[2026-01-11] #9 feat: add multi-model AI provider support (Claude + Gemini)
- Files: src/types/index.ts, src/lib/config.ts, src/lib/ai-provider.ts, src/utils/validators.ts, src/utils/logger.ts, src/commands/run.ts, src/commands/create.ts, src/commands/pr.ts, src/commands/status.ts, src/index.ts, src/lib/ai-provider.test.ts, src/lib/config.test.ts
- Changes: Added AIProvider type and AIConfig interface. Created ai-provider.ts abstraction layer supporting Claude and Gemini CLIs with auto-fallback on rate limits. Added --provider flag to run/create/pr commands. Updated status command to show AI provider info.
- Decisions: Kept claude.ts for prompt building (backward compat), new ai-provider.ts handles invocation. GENT_AI_PROVIDER env var overrides config.

[2026-01-11] #15 feat: add dynamic provider signature to issues and PRs
- Files: src/commands/create.ts, src/commands/pr.ts
- Changes: Appended "Created with {provider} by gent" footer to issue and PR bodies after AI generation.
- Decisions: Footer added programmatically after AI response (not in prompt). Used existing getProviderDisplayName().

[2026-01-11] #17 fix: update issue labels to ai-completed after PR creation
- Files: src/commands/pr.ts
- Changes: Added missing label update logic to transition issues from ai-in-progress to ai-completed after successful PR creation.
- Decisions: Label update is provider-agnostic (applies to Claude, Gemini, etc). Non-critical errors are silently ignored.

[2026-01-11] #19 fix: correct Gemini CLI invocation for interactive implementation mode
- Files: src/lib/ai-provider.ts, src/lib/ai-provider.test.ts
- Changes: Fixed invokeAIInteractive to use `-i` flag for Gemini CLI, enabling interactive mode with initial prompt instead of one-shot mode that exits immediately.
- Decisions: Gemini requires `-i/--prompt-interactive` flag to stay in interactive mode after executing initial prompt, unlike Claude which defaults to interactive.

[2026-01-11] #21 refactor: cleanup unused code in prompts.ts
- Files: src/lib/prompts.ts
- Changes: Removed invokeClaude and invokeClaudeInteractive functions and unused imports. File now solely focuses on prompt generation.
- Decisions: Verified that functionality is fully covered by ai-provider.ts.

[2026-01-11] #21 feat: dynamic Co-Authored-By trailer
- Files: src/lib/prompts.ts, src/lib/ai-provider.ts, src/lib/prompts.test.ts, src/commands/init.ts, templates/AGENT.md
- Changes: Updated prompt generation to use dynamic provider name and email for Co-Authored-By trailer. Updated templates to be generic.
- Decisions: Using noreply@anthropic.com and noreply@google.com for respective providers.

[2026-01-11] #21 refactor: rename claude.ts to prompts.ts
- Files: src/lib/prompts.ts, src/lib/prompts.test.ts, src/commands/run.ts, src/commands/create.ts, src/commands/pr.ts, README.md, AGENT.md
- Changes: Renamed Claude-specific file to reflect its generic prompt-building nature. Updated all imports and documentation.
- Decisions: Aligned naming with the multi-model AI provider abstraction.

[2026-01-12] #23 feat: generate ticket title from CLI command prompt
- Files: src/lib/prompts.ts, src/lib/prompts.test.ts, src/commands/create.ts, src/index.ts
- Changes: Added AI-generated title extraction from ticket output. Prompt now requests TITLE line. Added extractTitle() and generateFallbackTitle() functions. Added --title flag for manual override.
- Decisions: Title limit extended to 200 chars. Fallback truncates at word boundary without ellipsis. Validation rejects placeholders and too short (<5) titles.

[2026-01-12] #25 feat: display CLI version in status and help command outputs
- Files: src/lib/version.ts, src/lib/version.test.ts, src/index.ts, src/commands/status.ts
- Changes: Created getVersion() utility to read version from package.json. Updated status command header to show version. Refactored index.ts to use shared version utility.
- Decisions: Single source of truth in package.json. Commander.js .version() already configured.

[2026-01-12] #27 feat: add version check to detect and notify users of CLI updates
- Files: src/lib/version.ts, src/lib/version.test.ts, src/index.ts, src/commands/status.ts, eslint.config.js
- Changes: Added npm registry fetch with caching (~/.gent/version-check.json), non-blocking startup check via Commander preAction hook, --skip-update-check flag, and update display in status command.
- Decisions: 24h cache interval, 3s fetch timeout, native fetch API (Node 20+). GENT_SKIP_UPDATE_CHECK=1 env var also disables checks.
\n[2026-01-14] #31 feat: add support for OpenAI Codex as an AI provider\n- Files: src/types/index.ts, src/utils/validators.ts, src/utils/validators.test.ts, src/lib/ai-provider.ts, src/lib/ai-provider.test.ts, src/commands/init.ts, src/lib/config.ts, README.md, AGENT.md\n- Changes: Added support for 'codex' as an AI provider, using the 'openai' CLI. Updated types, validators, and AI provider logic. Added 'codex' to the init command and documentation.\n- Decisions: Assumed the 'openai' CLI follows a similar invocation pattern to 'gemini' and 'claude' for simplicity, as suggested by the issue. Used 'noreply@openai.com' for the co-author email.

[2026-01-14] #33 feat: add gent fix command for review feedback
- Files: src/commands/fix.ts, src/index.ts, src/lib/github.ts, src/lib/prompts.ts, src/lib/review-feedback.ts, src/lib/review-feedback.test.ts, src/lib/prompts.test.ts, src/lib/ai-provider.test.ts, src/types/index.ts
- Changes: Added gent fix command to pull PR review feedback, summarize actionable items, and re-run the implementation prompt with review context. Added review feedback parsing helpers and tests, plus prompt and GitHub helper updates.
- Decisions: Summarized actionable feedback using review states, unresolved threads, and keyword heuristics; exit when no actionable feedback exists.

[2026-01-14] #35 fix: use GraphQL API for PR review threads and add timestamp filtering
- Files: src/lib/github.ts, src/lib/git.ts, src/lib/review-feedback.ts, src/commands/fix.ts, src/types/index.ts, src/lib/review-feedback.test.ts
- Changes: Fixed getPrReviewData to use GraphQL for review threads. Added PR comments fetching. Added timestamp filtering to only show feedback after last commit (unresolved threads always shown). Added getLastCommitTimestamp helper. Auto-replies to feedback items after successful fix.
- Decisions: GraphQL query fetches repo owner/name first. Graceful fallback to empty threads if GraphQL fails. Unresolved threads always included regardless of timestamp. Reply failures silently ignored.

[2026-01-14] #37 docs: update README with gent fix workflow and PR iteration
- Files: README.md, progress.txt
- Changes: Added gent fix command documentation, updated workflow diagram to show review iteration loop, added PR review iteration tips section with usage examples.
- Decisions: Kept documentation concise with focus on practical workflow. Diagram shows branching review cycle.

[2026-01-14] #37 docs: address review feedback for README update
- Files: README.md
- Changes: Changed "items" to "comments" and "feedback" for consistency. Expanded explanation of the PR review iteration cycle.
- Decisions: Aligned terminology with reviewer suggestions.

[2026-01-15] #39 feat: enhance status command to show PR state and actionable review feedback
- Files: src/commands/status.ts, src/lib/github.ts, src/lib/review-feedback.ts, src/lib/review-feedback.test.ts
- Changes: Added getPrStatus() for PR state (open/closed/merged) and reviewDecision. Added countActionableFeedback() helper. Status now shows PR state, review decision, actionable comment counts with `gent fix` suggestion, and state-specific suggestions.
- Decisions: Reused existing extractReviewFeedbackItems logic. Suggestions adapt based on PR state and feedback availability.

[2026-01-15] #41 fix: duplicate "Update available" message in status command
- Files: src/commands/status.ts
- Changes: Removed duplicate update check from status command. The preAction hook in index.ts now handles update checks consistently for all commands.
- Decisions: Single update check strategy via preAction hook; removed special-case logic from status command.
