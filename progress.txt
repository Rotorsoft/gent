[2026-01-10] #4 feat: add progress indicator and approval flow to create command
- Files: src/commands/create.ts, src/lib/claude.ts, src/index.ts, src/lib/claude.test.ts
- Changes: Added visual framing around Claude streaming output, ticket preview before creation, inquirer confirmation with create/edit/cancel options, and --yes flag for CI automation.
- Decisions: Used chalk for visual frame borders, accumulated hints across regeneration cycles, truncated body preview at 500 chars.

[2026-01-10] #11 fix: replace bordered table with section-based ticket preview
- Files: src/commands/create.ts
- Changes: Replaced logger.box() bordered table with clean section-based format using chalk styling. Labels displayed inline, body content shown with indentation for readability.
- Decisions: Used bold cyan headers for sections, removed 500-char truncation to show full body content for better review.

[2026-01-10] #10 fix: strip AI preamble from generated ticket bodies
- Files: src/lib/claude.ts, src/lib/claude.test.ts
- Changes: Added explicit instruction in prompt to start with "## Description" without preamble. Updated extractIssueBody to strip any text before "## Description" as safety measure.
- Decisions: Two-layer defense: prompt instruction + extraction cleanup.

[2026-01-11] #9 feat: add multi-model AI provider support (Claude + Gemini)
- Files: src/types/index.ts, src/lib/config.ts, src/lib/ai-provider.ts, src/utils/validators.ts, src/utils/logger.ts, src/commands/run.ts, src/commands/create.ts, src/commands/pr.ts, src/commands/status.ts, src/index.ts, src/lib/ai-provider.test.ts, src/lib/config.test.ts
- Changes: Added AIProvider type and AIConfig interface. Created ai-provider.ts abstraction layer supporting Claude and Gemini CLIs with auto-fallback on rate limits. Added --provider flag to run/create/pr commands. Updated status command to show AI provider info.
- Decisions: Kept claude.ts for prompt building (backward compat), new ai-provider.ts handles invocation. GENT_AI_PROVIDER env var overrides config.
