[2026-01-10] #4 feat: add progress indicator and approval flow to create command
- Files: src/commands/create.ts, src/lib/claude.ts, src/index.ts, src/lib/claude.test.ts
- Changes: Added visual framing around Claude streaming output, ticket preview before creation, inquirer confirmation with create/edit/cancel options, and --yes flag for CI automation.
- Decisions: Used chalk for visual frame borders, accumulated hints across regeneration cycles, truncated body preview at 500 chars.

[2026-01-10] #11 fix: replace bordered table with section-based ticket preview
- Files: src/commands/create.ts
- Changes: Replaced logger.box() bordered table with clean section-based format using chalk styling. Labels displayed inline, body content shown with indentation for readability.
- Decisions: Used bold cyan headers for sections, removed 500-char truncation to show full body content for better review.

[2026-01-10] #10 fix: strip AI preamble from generated ticket bodies
- Files: src/lib/claude.ts, src/lib/claude.test.ts
- Changes: Added explicit instruction in prompt to start with "## Description" without preamble. Updated extractIssueBody to strip any text before "## Description" as safety measure.
- Decisions: Two-layer defense: prompt instruction + extraction cleanup.

[2026-01-11] #9 feat: add multi-model AI provider support (Claude + Gemini)
- Files: src/types/index.ts, src/lib/config.ts, src/lib/ai-provider.ts, src/utils/validators.ts, src/utils/logger.ts, src/commands/run.ts, src/commands/create.ts, src/commands/pr.ts, src/commands/status.ts, src/index.ts, src/lib/ai-provider.test.ts, src/lib/config.test.ts
- Changes: Added AIProvider type and AIConfig interface. Created ai-provider.ts abstraction layer supporting Claude and Gemini CLIs with auto-fallback on rate limits. Added --provider flag to run/create/pr commands. Updated status command to show AI provider info.
- Decisions: Kept claude.ts for prompt building (backward compat), new ai-provider.ts handles invocation. GENT_AI_PROVIDER env var overrides config.

[2026-01-11] #15 feat: add dynamic provider signature to issues and PRs
- Files: src/commands/create.ts, src/commands/pr.ts
- Changes: Appended "Created with {provider} by gent" footer to issue and PR bodies after AI generation.
- Decisions: Footer added programmatically after AI response (not in prompt). Used existing getProviderDisplayName().

[2026-01-11] #17 fix: update issue labels to ai-completed after PR creation
- Files: src/commands/pr.ts
- Changes: Added missing label update logic to transition issues from ai-in-progress to ai-completed after successful PR creation.
- Decisions: Label update is provider-agnostic (applies to Claude, Gemini, etc). Non-critical errors are silently ignored.

[2026-01-11] #19 fix: correct Gemini CLI invocation for interactive implementation mode
- Files: src/lib/ai-provider.ts, src/lib/ai-provider.test.ts
- Changes: Fixed invokeAIInteractive to use `-i` flag for Gemini CLI, enabling interactive mode with initial prompt instead of one-shot mode that exits immediately.
- Decisions: Gemini requires `-i/--prompt-interactive` flag to stay in interactive mode after executing initial prompt, unlike Claude which defaults to interactive.

[2026-01-11] #21 refactor: cleanup unused code in prompts.ts
- Files: src/lib/prompts.ts
- Changes: Removed invokeClaude and invokeClaudeInteractive functions and unused imports. File now solely focuses on prompt generation.
- Decisions: Verified that functionality is fully covered by ai-provider.ts.

[2026-01-11] #21 feat: dynamic Co-Authored-By trailer
- Files: src/lib/prompts.ts, src/lib/ai-provider.ts, src/lib/prompts.test.ts, src/commands/init.ts, templates/AGENT.md
- Changes: Updated prompt generation to use dynamic provider name and email for Co-Authored-By trailer. Updated templates to be generic.
- Decisions: Using noreply@anthropic.com and noreply@google.com for respective providers.

[2026-01-11] #21 refactor: rename claude.ts to prompts.ts
- Files: src/lib/prompts.ts, src/lib/prompts.test.ts, src/commands/run.ts, src/commands/create.ts, src/commands/pr.ts, README.md, AGENT.md
- Changes: Renamed Claude-specific file to reflect its generic prompt-building nature. Updated all imports and documentation.
- Decisions: Aligned naming with the multi-model AI provider abstraction.

[2026-01-12] #23 feat: generate ticket title from CLI command prompt
- Files: src/lib/prompts.ts, src/lib/prompts.test.ts, src/commands/create.ts, src/index.ts
- Changes: Added AI-generated title extraction from ticket output. Prompt now requests TITLE line. Added extractTitle() and generateFallbackTitle() functions. Added --title flag for manual override.
- Decisions: Title limit extended to 200 chars. Fallback truncates at word boundary without ellipsis. Validation rejects placeholders and too short (<5) titles.

[2026-01-12] #25 feat: display CLI version in status and help command outputs
- Files: src/lib/version.ts, src/lib/version.test.ts, src/index.ts, src/commands/status.ts
- Changes: Created getVersion() utility to read version from package.json. Updated status command header to show version. Refactored index.ts to use shared version utility.
- Decisions: Single source of truth in package.json. Commander.js .version() already configured.

[2026-01-12] #27 feat: add version check to detect and notify users of CLI updates
- Files: src/lib/version.ts, src/lib/version.test.ts, src/index.ts, src/commands/status.ts, eslint.config.js
- Changes: Added npm registry fetch with caching (~/.gent/version-check.json), non-blocking startup check via Commander preAction hook, --skip-update-check flag, and update display in status command.
- Decisions: 24h cache interval, 3s fetch timeout, native fetch API (Node 20+). GENT_SKIP_UPDATE_CHECK=1 env var also disables checks.
\n[2026-01-14] #31 feat: add support for OpenAI Codex as an AI provider\n- Files: src/types/index.ts, src/utils/validators.ts, src/utils/validators.test.ts, src/lib/ai-provider.ts, src/lib/ai-provider.test.ts, src/commands/init.ts, src/lib/config.ts, README.md, AGENT.md\n- Changes: Added support for 'codex' as an AI provider, using the 'openai' CLI. Updated types, validators, and AI provider logic. Added 'codex' to the init command and documentation.\n- Decisions: Assumed the 'openai' CLI follows a similar invocation pattern to 'gemini' and 'claude' for simplicity, as suggested by the issue. Used 'noreply@openai.com' for the co-author email.

[2026-01-14] #33 feat: add gent fix command for review feedback
- Files: src/commands/fix.ts, src/index.ts, src/lib/github.ts, src/lib/prompts.ts, src/lib/review-feedback.ts, src/lib/review-feedback.test.ts, src/lib/prompts.test.ts, src/lib/ai-provider.test.ts, src/types/index.ts
- Changes: Added gent fix command to pull PR review feedback, summarize actionable items, and re-run the implementation prompt with review context. Added review feedback parsing helpers and tests, plus prompt and GitHub helper updates.
- Decisions: Summarized actionable feedback using review states, unresolved threads, and keyword heuristics; exit when no actionable feedback exists.

[2026-01-14] #35 fix: use GraphQL API for PR review threads and add timestamp filtering
- Files: src/lib/github.ts, src/lib/git.ts, src/lib/review-feedback.ts, src/commands/fix.ts, src/types/index.ts, src/lib/review-feedback.test.ts
- Changes: Fixed getPrReviewData to use GraphQL for review threads. Added PR comments fetching. Added timestamp filtering to only show feedback after last commit (unresolved threads always shown). Added getLastCommitTimestamp helper. Auto-replies to feedback items after successful fix.
- Decisions: GraphQL query fetches repo owner/name first. Graceful fallback to empty threads if GraphQL fails. Unresolved threads always included regardless of timestamp. Reply failures silently ignored.

[2026-01-14] #37 docs: update README with gent fix workflow and PR iteration
- Files: README.md, progress.txt
- Changes: Added gent fix command documentation, updated workflow diagram to show review iteration loop, added PR review iteration tips section with usage examples.
- Decisions: Kept documentation concise with focus on practical workflow. Diagram shows branching review cycle.

[2026-01-14] #37 docs: address review feedback for README update
- Files: README.md
- Changes: Changed "items" to "comments" and "feedback" for consistency. Expanded explanation of the PR review iteration cycle.
- Decisions: Aligned terminology with reviewer suggestions.

[2026-01-15] #39 feat: enhance status command to show PR state and actionable review feedback
- Files: src/commands/status.ts, src/lib/github.ts, src/lib/review-feedback.ts, src/lib/review-feedback.test.ts
- Changes: Added getPrStatus() for PR state (open/closed/merged) and reviewDecision. Added countActionableFeedback() helper. Status now shows PR state, review decision, actionable comment counts with `gent fix` suggestion, and state-specific suggestions.
- Decisions: Reused existing extractReviewFeedbackItems logic. Suggestions adapt based on PR state and feedback availability.

[2026-01-15] #41 fix: duplicate "Update available" message in status command
- Files: src/commands/status.ts
- Changes: Removed duplicate update check from status command. The preAction hook in index.ts now handles update checks consistently for all commands.
- Decisions: Single update check strategy via preAction hook; removed special-case logic from status command.

[2026-01-26] #45 feat: add Playwright video capture for UI changes in PRs
- Files: src/types/index.ts, src/lib/config.ts, src/lib/playwright.ts, src/lib/github-assets.ts, src/commands/pr.ts, src/index.ts, src/lib/playwright.test.ts, src/lib/github-assets.test.ts
- Changes: Added VideoConfig type and configuration. Created playwright.ts for Playwright detection and UI change heuristics. When UI changes detected and Playwright available, adds instructions to AI prompt for video capture via MCP. Created github-assets.ts utility for future use.
- Decisions: Video capture enabled by default, disabled via .gent.yml or --no-video. AI handles video capture autonomously via MCP (no manual URL needed). UI detection uses file patterns (tsx, vue, components/, pages/, etc).

[2026-01-28] #47 feat: add interactive dashboard with context-aware workflow actions
- Files: src/tui/state.ts, src/tui/actions.ts, src/tui/display.ts, src/tui/state.test.ts, src/tui/actions.test.ts, src/commands/tui.ts, src/index.ts, src/lib/prompts.ts, README.md, AGENT.md, progress.txt
- Changes: Added dashboard launched via `gent` (no args) or `gent ui`. Panels for Ticket/Branch/PR/Commits with keyboard shortcuts at bottom. State aggregation from git, GitHub issues/PRs, labels, and Playwright. Video capture prompt builder for UI changes. Dashboard auto-refreshes after actions.
- Decisions: Used existing inquirer+chalk+ora instead of adding TUI library. Raw stdin for single-key input. htop-inspired panel layout with badges. No action menu - bottom command bar with shortcuts instead.

[2026-01-28] #49 fix: fix TUI command execution and standardize modal dialogs
- Files: src/commands/tui.ts, src/tui/actions.ts, src/tui/display.ts, src/tui/actions.test.ts, src/commands/create.ts, src/commands/run.ts
- Changes: Replaced process.exit calls with return in create/run commands to prevent TUI termination. Renamed fix action to implement (shortcut i) for context-aware implementation. Added renderActionPanel for framed output. Included review feedback context in implementation prompts. Added error handling around TUI command calls.
- Decisions: Kept command functions reusable by replacing process.exit with return. Action panel shows session context before handing off to AI provider.
